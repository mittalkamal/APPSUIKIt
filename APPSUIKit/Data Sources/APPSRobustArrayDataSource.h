/**
 This class implements the Array Data Source concept described in the online magazine
 objc.io, in its inaugural issue: http://www.objc.io/issue-1/lighter-view-controllers.html.
 It was written by Chris Eidhof: https://twitter.com/chriseidhof
 
 This class has been adapted to use some Appstronomy conventions and typedefs.
 
 The goal here, is for you to set an instance of this class as your table view controller's
 data source, instead of burdening your view controller with data source logic.
 
 This is only applicable if in this case, your backing data can be expressed as an NSArray.
 If your data set is massive, you'll want to instead use an NSFetchedResultsController,
 and an accordingly intelligent data source to drive it.
 
 We've extended the original concept to include support for multiple sections.
